Mummer 4.0.0 Oct 02, 2020
Downloaded from https://github.com/mummer4/mummer/releases/tag/v4.0.0rc1

Changes:
scripts/promer.pl does not work 'as is' with SyMAP, so was modified as specified by:
https://github.com/mummer4/mummer/issues/55 jerviadog's fix

To use:
1.  cd symap_5/ext/mummer4 
	tar xf mummer-4.0.0rc1.symap.tar.gz	
	pwd
	cd mummer-4.0.0rc1
	./configure --prefix={result of pwd + "/m4"} (e.g. /Users/cari/Workspace/symap_5/ext/mummer4/m4)
	make
	make install
	
2. Uncomment line in symap_5/symap.config and add your full path
	#mummer_path =
	
I believe mummer4 will work if placed somewhere else, but make sure that it has the promer.pl fix!

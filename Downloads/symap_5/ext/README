>>MacOS Users  

All external packages had to be recompiled for MacOS Catalina 10.15.

The previous executables are saved in '_pre506'; if a new executable does not work,
replace it with the one with the '_pre506' suffix. Otherwise, try compiling the 
program on your machine and replacing the executable in its respective /mac directory.
If it still does not work, email symap@agcol.arizona.edu.

Mac Catalina 10.15
The programs will not run until you do the following for the five scripts in mac:
	Open a Finder window.
	Select the program.
	Open
	It will prompt you: MacOS cannot verify the developer of "mummer". Are you sure you want to open it?
	Reply "Open".
After that, SyMAP will be able to run it.
